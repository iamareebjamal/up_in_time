# up_in_time
It is a django-powered web app which can create reminders or alarms just by a single click.

## Installation
* Just clone the git repo.
* OPen the terminal and cd into the folder 
* Run ```./manage.py runserver```
* Visit [here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/alarm/) (If you haven't changed the default port - 8000)

##Strategy:
* When user opens the home page - the index.html it is handled by alarm view that creates a database entry with mapping of id to alarm_time,thus making a POST request and then redirects to success.html
* Now, success.html is mapped to create_alarm view and in turn it checks for the alarm_time written for the current IP address and it then displays the current time and then the javascript can check for that when the alarm time comes, we can play the music requested.

##Still To-Do:

* Obviously, give it some *better* looks.
* Add a level of validation for IP and time.
* Add an alert message when user tries to close the alarm tab.
* Add a message input and display it on tha alarm screen for eminding purposes.
* optimize the code - Use django's template system
* Design GUI and choose colors.
* ~~Embed music in pop up so that there is actually an alarm~~
* ~~Seperate the Javascript and HTML in pop-up.~~
* Add customization to alarm screen.
* ~~Make and add a favicon~~
* Add contact us, about_us page.
	
### Far away:
